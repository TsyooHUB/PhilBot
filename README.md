# PhilBot


A Python Discord bot using discord.py to get some experience with Python and just for fun.


The bot needs a PhilPhrases.txt and a PhilCoinRegister.txt file, but those were not uploaded since they are just empty files.
Their purpose is to store data, since I didn't want to create a database for a side project like this one.
